# wikidvue-server

[WikidVue](https://github.com/rthomasv3/wikidvue) is a work in progress note taking app with markdown support. The goal of the project is to create a simple and clean app you can host yourself with a mobile first design and PWA. This is a work-in-progress sync server for that project.
